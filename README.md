# Book Search Engine Starter Code

## Description
This application and Challenge was emant to teach us how to properly utilize a GraphQL API, from configuring a schemas folder with resolvers and typeDefs to refactoring multiple files that were set up to host a RESTful API. The application itself is a book search engine that provides users with, when searched, books related to their search. It also allows the user to create an account and log in to said account, and provides authentication for the user to secure their account. 

## Disclosures
To complete this Challenge, I had the help of my tutor, Eric, and my instructor Louis, as well as the Xpert Learning Assistant. Erik and Louis were both incredibly helpful in refactoring much of the code.
